# Overview: In this assignment, you'll explore the Jupyter environment and notebooks - a web-based approach that combines code with formatted text and automatic display of results.  We'll look at tools for working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional data.  We'll explore the string class and let you know that regular expressions exist to help us identify and parse elements of text (e.g. a phone number or web address). 

# TASK 1 - use markdown to label your jupyter notebook. Import panda and use the series functions.Follow the instructions in the "Dictionary Initializers' subsection to modify your code to initialize grades with a dictionary (a set of key-value pairs instead 

# TASK 2 - Create a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary (a set of key-value pairs) holding multiple exam scores for each key/student. Customize a DataFrame's Indices with the index Attribute subsection. Use loc['ColA'] and iloc[i]  to access rows by name and index, respectively. Use grades.describe() to get descriptive statistics for our gradebook columns. Learn how to sort rows and columns.
